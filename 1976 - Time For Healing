The recent resignations of Spiro Agnew & Richard Nixon as well as the untimely assassination of Gerald Ford allowed long-time candidate Nelson Rockefeller to clench the presidency at a time of domestic turmoil. The economy remains stagnant as inflation and unemployment eat away the jobs of common Americans. The Soviets remain a threat as South Vietnam falls & the failures of Tricky Dick loom large over the Republic.<br><br>Americans increasingly turn towards the Democrats for answers with California governor Jerry Brown. Some conservatives upset at Rockefeller's shock victory against Reagan flock to Jesse Helms' right-wing third party candidacy hoping to send the election to the House, leaving president Rockefeller to fight an uphill battle.</p>",
