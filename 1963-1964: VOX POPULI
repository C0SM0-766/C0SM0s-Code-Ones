From once a measly weather reporter to now controlling the strings of the most viewed cable news networks, Vincent has undoubtedly lived the American dream. But for some like himself, it is never enough to have it all. Yes, he's the de facto controller of American television, but it just doesn't cut it for a greedy guy like him.<br><br>Venturing into the realm of American politics seems to sate his desires. Coming out as a Democrat & winning the governorship for the state of Maryland, his ascendancy to the Vice Presidency was secured. With him on the ticket, John F. Kennedy was able to gain the state and exceeding expectations—he miraculously held onto southern swing states such as Texas.<br><br>The Vice Presidency wasn't worth a bucket of warm piss. Whittman found himself doing frustratingly little as the Kennedys took on most of actual governing. With a heart now filled full of resentment, he visits the CIA, gets into contact with an obscure Dallas native, and hands him a Carcano Rifle with one mission:<br><br><b>Kill the president.</b></p>",
